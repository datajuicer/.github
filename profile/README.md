# 🍊 Welcome to Data-Juicer!

### Open, modular data engineering for **every intelligent application**

We’re the *Data-Juicer team* — a group of researchers, engineers, and open-source enthusiasts from Tongyi Lab and the data intelligence community.
We believe **great AI starts with great data**, but today’s data development is hard to reuse, fragmented to model, and far from intelligence.

So we’re building *Data-Juicer*: a community-driven ecosystem to make data processing more **simple, composable, and valable** — whether you’re working on:

- 🧠 LLMs / VLMs / pre-training / post-tuning
- 🤖 Agents & autonomous systems  
- 📊 BI, document intelligence, or knowledge extraction  
- 🚗 Embodied AI, autopilot, or simulation  
- 🧬 AI for science, healthcare, finance, and beyond

## 🌍 A Modular Ecosystem, Built Together

After the growth of real-world use across academia and industry, we’re *reimagining Data-Juicer as a more open ecosystem*:

- ✨ **Modular by design**: Use only what you need, like hundreds of operators, data-model co-dev sandbox, data agents
- ⚡️ **Unmatched Efficiency**: Accelerate your data workflows with good scalability and deep optimization
- 🧩 **Easy to extend**: Add your own operators, data recipes, or domain-specific and new modules  
- 🤝 **Open to all**: Students, data hackers, researchers, startups, and enterprises — all are welcome

> 🔧 We’re currently migrating from a monolith to lighter repos under this org. This is the beginning of a more flexible, community-driven future.
